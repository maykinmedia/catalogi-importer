The Catalogi Importer project was initiated by the municipality of Delft and 
allows users to load i-Navigator exports into the Catalogi API.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who laid the groundwork, have submitted patches, reported bugs, added
translations, helped answer questions, and generally made the components that 
much better:

    Anna Shamray <anna@maykinmedia.nl>
    Joeri Bekker <joeri@maykinmedia.nl>
    Sergei Maertens <sergei@maykinmedia.nl>
    Bart van der Schoor <bart@maykinmedia.nl>

A big THANK YOU goes to:

    The municipality of Delft for their active support in creating this 
    application.

    All people behind Common Ground for their enthusiasm and vision.
