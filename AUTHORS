Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who laid the groundwork, have submitted patches, reported bugs, added
translations, helped answer questions, and generally made everything that much
better:

    Anna Shamray <anna@maykinmedia.nl>
    Joeri Bekker <joeri@maykinmedia.nl>
    Bart van der Schoor <bart@maykinmedia.nl>

A big THANK YOU goes to:

    All municipalities who initiated the project.

    All people behind Common Ground for their enthusiasm and vision.
