**Easily import i-Navigator exports into the Catalogi API, such as the one in**
`Open Zaak`_.

The `Catalogi API`_ is the main place to store your zaaktypes when using the
`API's voor Zaakgericht Werken`_, part of the `Common Ground`_ landscape.
However, many municipalities currently have their zaaktypes stored in
i-Navigator.

To keep the manual overhead to a minimum, the Catalogi Importer can load
i-Navigator exports into any catalog present in a Catalogi API. All zaaktypes
are created as concepts, so you can easily make additional changes afterwards
if needed.
